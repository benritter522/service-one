## Summary
### Purpose
We built Villagr, an e-Commerce web platform focused on **promoting small businesses in need**.  

### Problem
- **Small-business owners** and **service providers** that are struggling financially need to be **prioritized** and given more **visibility** in online spaces.
- **Potential customers** are interested in supporting and buying from struggling local small service businesses.

### Solution
Create a website that allows users to search and browse local service providers, prioritizing businesses based on each company's critical **need**, rather than rating or popularity.

## Background & Context
With small service businesses shuttering around the country, Villagr has identified a way to help uplift and positively impact small businesses and help them reach and connected to their customers. What happens when no one is out in the world, looking for places to try? To help small businesses stay relevant to the new, socially distant and virtual society, we pivoted to making sure customers can share and book businesses that most urgently need local rallying support to survive. Villagr is built to help small businesses reach new audiences, and to inspire folks to support local entrepreneurship.

The Villagr team is a group of innovators and changemakers dedicated to business transformation.

As Grace Hopper, inventor of the **common business** -oriented language, once said:
>Humans are allergic to change. 
>They love to say, 'We've always done it this way.' I try to fight that.
